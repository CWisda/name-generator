 #Random Name Generator
1. Selects from a pool of at least ten names of your classmates
2. Contains `Generate Random Names` button that initiates the selection of 4 random names (duplicate names are OK)
3. The selected random names are displayed to the browser
4. Each time the `Generate Random Names` button is pressed, a new set of names appears (replacing the previous set of 4 random names)
5. Contains button named `Clear` that removes the populated list from the screen
6. Once you have completed steps 1-6, try to complete the Stretch Goals listed below.

### Stretch Goals

- Use `window.prompt()` to allow the user to enter the number of names they want (up to 20 names).
  - Info on `window.prompt()`: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_prompt.asp
- The Random Name Generator should select and display the specified number of names to the browser window.
- If the user inputs a number higher than 20, an `alert` box should appear informing the user that they should enter a number below 20.
